Today’s post is about [Commit Conf](https://2025.commit-conf.com), a Spanish event held in Madrid aimed at giving professionals the opportunity to learn, stay up to date with new technologies, and connect with others in the industry.

It was my first time at Commit Conf and I expected it to be a great opportunity to improve my technical skills — and it definitely was — but I ended up gaining much more than I anticipated.

## Barcelona to Madrid

I'm from Barcelona, so I had to take quite a trip to Madrid. After a high-speed train and a few subway transfers, I arrived at the venue — CEU San Pablo University in Montepríncipe.

My first impression? Wow! The staff were incredibly kind, and the event was impressively well-structured and organized. Everything ran on time, was easy to follow, and clearly guided by the amazing event team.

## Best moments

The talks I attended were incredibly insightful and valuable — every topic across the five tracks was worth it, and choosing between them was honestly a tough call.

But the best part of the event wasn’t just the content — it was the people and the face-to-face connections I made between sessions. Manu, Agustí, Jonathan, Raúl, Gabriel, Pablo, Pedro, and many more — I had the chance to meet new folks and reconnect with familiar faces.

## Looking forwards

Attending Commit Conf was an incredibly enriching experience, and the takeaways were countless. I’m truly grateful to my company, Tymit, for providing the resources and support that made it possible for me to attend.

Now, I’m looking forward to the next tech events — always with the goal of learning and connecting with more amazing people.
